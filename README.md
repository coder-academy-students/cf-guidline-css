# Coder Factory CSS Design Guideline
Coder Factory Guideline CSS Design

### CSS File names
So that Coder Factory staff can differentiate between Coder factory css files and third party css files, we reccommend that file names be prepended with "cf_"

i.e.
```
bootstrap.css
cf_styles.css
cf_main.css
```


### "cf-" Name convention for CSS
To prevent custom CSS clashing with classes or names of imported css libraries from third parties such as bootstrap or materializecss, Coder Factory designers can use the following convention for consitancy, readablity and familiarity.

We reccommended that each css class begins with the "cf-" name followed by the css class name.

i.e.
```
.cf-text-bold {

}
```
